### **Game rules**
This game is desiged to help you learn basic animal vocabulary in Portugese.
In the beginning you'll be shown a list of animals in the following format: english name : portugese name (f.ex. horse : cavalo).
After you close the list, the proper game begins:
- The player flips one card over to reveal animal icon/name and then turns over a second card, trying to find the match.
- Two flipped cards are counted as one move; timer starts with the first card flipped.
- If cards don’t match, they are flipped back.
- If cards match, animal icon and name change background to green and remain visible.
- Your score (moves, time and rating) is being displayed in the score panel.
- Timer starts when the first card is flipped.
- Reload icon restarts the game, bulb icon shows vocabulary list.
- The player wins when all 10 cards are matched.
Once the game is finished, a popup with the player's result is shown.
- By pressing "Play again" button, you may start a new game.
